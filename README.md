# GrowHost
Cache/OSM Free Hosting using GitHub Pages!

# Features
- Very Fast.
- Anti-DDoS Protection.
- Easy to Setup.

# Config
Just edit variable `config` at [script](script.js)

# Known Issues
- GitHub Pages doesn't support terminal output, so if your file missing will be hard to detect it.
- GitHub Pages doesn't support for host server_data.php because the GitHub Pages use subdomain from github.io, also doesn't support POST requests (maybe).
